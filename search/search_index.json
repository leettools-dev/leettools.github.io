However, instead of simple question-answering interactions,  sometimes we need to perform more complex search-based tasks that need iterative workflows, personalized data curation, and domain-specific knowledge integration. </p> <p>```Markdown title=\"Example: Search and Summarize\" When we do a web search, since the content we need may not always be available on the  first page of search results, can we go a few more pages to find only relevant documents and then summarize the relevant information? For such a search workflow, we can: 1. Use a search engine to fetch the top documents, up to X pages. 2. Crawl the result URLs to fetch the content. 3. Use LLM to summarize the content of each page to see if the content is relevant. 4. We can also crawl links found in the content to fetch more relevant information. 5. When we reach a predefined threshold, say number of relevant documents, or number of    iterations, we can stop the search. 6. Aggregate all the relevant summaries to generate a list of topics discussed in the    search results. 7. Use the topics to generate a digest article that summarizes the search results.</p> <pre><code>\nHere are a few more examples:\n- Simple:\n    - Search and summarize: search for a topic, in the search results, go through the top\n        X instead of only the top 10, filter out the unrelated ones, generate a digest \n        article from the search results.\n    - Customized search: Can I limit my search to a specific domain or source or a date range? \n        Can I query in language X, search in language Y, and generate the answer in language Z?\n        Can I exclude the search results from a specific source? Can I generate the results\n        in a specific style with a specific length?\n- Complex:\n    - Extract and dedupe: find all entities that satisfy a condition, extract required\n        information as structured data, and deduplicate the results.\n    - Search and aggregate: given a product, search for all recently reviews and feedbacks,\n        identify the sentiment, the product aspects, and the suggestions, aggregate the\n        results based on the sentiment and the aspects.\n- Hard:\n    - Dynamic streaming queries: monitor the web for a specific topic, find the \"new\" and \"hot\"\n        information that I have not seen before and satisfies a certain criteria, summarize\n        or extract the content I need and generate a report in my customized format.\n\nAfter analyzing why it is hard to implement such tasks, we found that the main reason\nis the lack of data support for the iterative workflows. Therefore, we want to make \na persistent data layer to support the complex logic required for such tasks.\n\n\n## Solution: search flow with a document pipeline\nLeetTools enables implementation of automated search flows backed by a local document\npipeline. Besides the common benefits of a private deployment such as security and using\nlocal models, LeetTools provides many benefits:\n\n- integrated pipeline to abstract away the complex setup for all the components;\n- easier to implement customized/automated/complex search-task logic;\n- better control over the indexing, retrieval, and ranking process;\n- allow personalized data curations and annotations process;\n- more flexible to adapt models and functionalities suitable for the requirements.\n\n\n## Key Components\n\n![LeetTools Document Pipeline](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pengfeng/4b2e36bda389e0a3c338b5c42b5d09c1/raw/6bc06db40dadf995212270d914b46281bf7edae9/leettools-eds-arch.svg)\n\nLeetTools provides the following key components:\n\n- A document pipeline to ingest, convert, chunk, embed, and index documents. User \n  specifies a document source such as a search query, a local directory, or a single \n  file, the pipeline will ingest the documents specified by the source to a document \n  sink (the original form of the document) and convert the original document into the\n  standard Markdown format document. The Markdown document is then split and indexed \n  using different configurable strategies. The pipeline is similar to the ETL process\n  of the data pipeline, but the target is now documents instead of structured or \n  semi-structured data.\n- A knowledge base to manage and serve the indexed documents, including the documents, \n  the segments, the embeddings, the document graph, the entity graph, which can be \n  supported by different storage plugins. In this version, we provide the DuckDB-based\n  implementations to minimize the resource footprint.\n- A search and retrieval library used by the document pipeline to retrieve documents. \n  We can use search APIs such as Google, Bing, and Tavily, and scraper APIs such as \n  Firecrawl or Crawl4AI. \n- A workflow engine to implement search-based AI workflows, which provides a thin-layer\n  of abstraction to manage the dependencies and configurations.\n- A configuration system to manage the configurations used in the pipeline, such as the\n  different endpoints, different parameters in the retrieval process, and etc.\n- A query history system to manage the history and the context of the queries.\n- A scheduler to schedule the execution of the ingestions. We provide a simple pull-based\n  scheduler that queries the knowledgebase and execute different tasks (ingestion,\n  converting, splitting, indexing) based on the status of the documents. It is possible to\n  schedule the tasks using more sophisticated schedulers, but we provide an integrated\n  simple scheduler to avoid complex setup and unnecessary dependencies for basic workloads.\n- An accounting system to track the usage of the LLM APIs. For all LLM API calls used in\n  the pipeline and workflow, the system records the prompts, the provider, the tokens\n  used, the results returned. The goal is to provide observability to the whole\n  pipeline and foundation for optimization.\n\nAll you need to do to implement a search-based AI tool is to write a single Python script\nthat organizes different components in the LeetTools framework. An example of such a\nscript is shown in \n[src/leettools/flow/flows/answer/flow_answer.py](src/leettools/flow/flows/answer/flow_answer.py), \nwhich implements the search-extract-answer flow similar to the existing AI search services.\n\nSo, if you want to implement personalized search-based workflows that can accumulate\ndomain-specific knowledge with a persistent local memory, but setting up all the \ncomponents from scratch is too much work, LeetTools is the right tool for you.\n\n## Demo Cases\n\nWe list a few demo use cases that are provided in the codebase:\n\n### Answer with references (similar to Perplexity AI)\n\nSearch the web or local KB with the query and answer with source references:\n\n- Perform the search with retriever: \"local\" for local KB, a search engine\n  (e.g., google) fetches top documents from the web. If no KB is specified, \n  create an adhoc KB; otherwise, save and process results in the KB.\n- New web search results are processed by the document pipeline: conversion,\n  chunking, and indexing.\n- Retrieve top matching segments from the KB based on the query.\n- Concatenate the segments to create context for the query.\n- Use the context to answer with source references via an LLM API call.\n\n### Search and Summarize\n\nWhen interested in a topic, you can generate a digest article from the search results:\n\n- Define search keywords and optional content instructions for relevance filtering.\n- Perform the search with retriever: \"local\" for local KB, a search engine (e.g., Google)\n  fetches top documents from the web. If no KB is specified, create an adhoc KB; \n  otherwise, save and process results in the KB.\n- New web search results are processed through the document pipeline: conversion, \n  chunking, and indexing.\n- Each result document is summarized using a LLM API call.\n- Generate a topic plan for the digest from the document summaries.\n- Create sections for each topic in the plan using content from the KB.\n- Concatenate sections into a complete digest article.\n\n### Search and Extract\n\nExtra structured data from web or local KB search results:\n- Perform the search with retriever: \"local\" for local KB, a search engine (e.g., Google)\n  fetches top documents from the web. If no KB is specified, create an adhoc KB; \n  otherwise, save and process results in the KB.\n- New web search results are processed through the document pipeline: conversion, \n  chunking, and indexing.\n- Extract structured data from matched documents based on the specified model.\n- Display the extracted data as a table in the output.\n\n\n### Search and generate with style\n\nYou can generate an article with a specific style from the search results. \n\n- Specify the number of days to search for news (right now only Google search is \n  supported for this option);\n- LeetTools crawls the web with the keywords in the topic and scrape the top documents to\n  the knowledge base;\n- Saved documents are processed through the document pipeline: conversion, chunking, and\n  indexing;\n- The summaries for the documents are provided to the LLM API to generate a news article\n  with the specified style;\n- You can specify the output language, the number of words, and article style.\n\n\n## Command line commands\n\nThen you can run the command line commands, assuming all commands are run under the root\ndirectory of the project. Run the \"leet list\" command to see all the available commands:\n\n```bash\n% leet list\nlist    List all CLI commands and subcommands.\n...\nflow    Run the flow for the query.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"documentation/#flow-execution","title":"flow execution","text":"<p>You can run any flow using the <code>leet flow</code> command.</p> <pre><code># list all the flows\nleet flow --list\n# check the parameters for a flow\nleet flow -t answer --info\n# run an answer flow with the default settings\nleet flow -t answer -q \"What is GraphRAG\"\n# run an answer flow with extra parameters, such as the days_limit and output_language\nleet flow -t answer -q \"What is GraphRAG\" -p days_limit=3 -p output_language=es\n# run an answer flow and save the output to a KB\nleet flow -t answer -q \"What is GraphRAG\" -k graphrag\n# run an answer flow on the local KB\nleet flow -t answer -q \"What is GraphRAG\" -k graphrag -p retriever_type=local\n# run an digest of search results from the last three days and output in Spanish\n# this query will run for a while to fetch and analyze the search results\nleet flow -t digest -q \"LLM GenAI News\" -k genai -p days_limit=3 -p output_language=es -l info\n# extract the structured data from the search results\nleet flow -t extract -q \"LLM GenAI Startup\" -k genai -p extract_pydantic=docs/company.py -l info\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Flow/answer/","title":"Answer","text":""},{"location":"Flow/answer/#feature-answer","title":"Feature: Answer","text":"<p>Description:</p> <p>The Answer workflow in LeetTools is designed to provide direct answers to user queries, enriched with source references.

The primary purpose of GraphRAG is to address the limitations of traditional RAG systems, particularly in handling complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning and a deeper understanding of relationships between entities.</p> <p>In conventional RAG systems, the retrieval process often relies on keyword or similarity-based searches, which can fall short when faced with intricate queries. For instance, a user might ask, \"Who directed the sci-fi movie where the lead actor was also in The Revenant?\" A standard RAG system would typically retrieve documents related to \"The Revenant\" and extract information about its cast and crew. However, it may struggle to connect the dots and identify that Leonardo DiCaprio, the lead actor, has starred in other films, thus failing to provide a comprehensive answer regarding the directors of those films. This limitation arises because traditional RAG systems do not effectively reason over structured information, which is essential for answering complex queries that involve multiple relationships and entities[2].</p> <p>GraphRAG addresses these challenges by leveraging knowledge graphs, which are structured representations of information that capture entities and their interconnections. Knowledge graphs allow for a more nuanced understanding of relationships, enabling the system to traverse through interconnected nodes and extract relevant information more effectively. For example, in the aforementioned query, GraphRAG would first identify the lead actor, then navigate through the knowledge graph to find other movies featuring DiCaprio, and finally retrieve the corresponding directors. This multi-hop reasoning capability is a significant enhancement over traditional RAG systems, which often lack the ability to perform such complex reasoning tasks[8].</p> <p>The architecture of GraphRAG consists of several key components, including a knowledge graph, a graph database, and a large language model (LLM). The knowledge graph serves as a structured repository of factual information, while the LLM acts as the reasoning engine that interprets user queries and generates coherent responses based on the retrieved knowledge. During the indexing phase, GraphRAG utilizes LLMs to automatically extract entities and relationships from a document collection, forming a knowledge graph that organizes this information hierarchically into semantic clusters. This process not only summarizes the information contained within the documents but also enhances the retrieval accuracy by allowing the system to focus on relevant concepts and entities during query processing[8][2].</p> <p>When a user submits a query, GraphRAG constructs a query graph that represents the user's intent and identifies key entities and relationships. The system then matches this query graph against the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant community summaries, which provide context for the LLM to generate a more informed and accurate response. This approach allows GraphRAG to address \"global queries\" that require aggregation across the entire document collection, rather than merely retrieving the top K chunks of information[2].</p> <p>In summary, GraphRAG significantly enhances the capabilities of retrieval-augmented generation systems by incorporating knowledge graphs, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and improved accuracy in response generation. This makes it particularly well-suited for applications that require a deep understanding of complex relationships and the ability to navigate large datasets effectively.</p>"},{"location":"Sample_Output/graphrag/#the-mechanism-of-graph-construction-in-graphrag","title":"The Mechanism of Graph Construction in GraphRAG","text":"<p>The construction of knowledge graphs in GraphRAG involves a systematic process that encompasses data collection, entity and relation extraction, and graph construction. This process is crucial for enabling the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to effectively leverage structured information for improved reasoning and response generation.</p> <p>Data collection is the initial step, where a comprehensive corpus of text data is gathered. This data can originate from various sources, including articles, research papers, and other textual documents that contain relevant information for the knowledge graph. The quality and breadth of this data are essential, as they directly influence the richness of the knowledge graph that will be constructed[1].</p> <p>Following data collection, the next phase involves entity and relation extraction. This is achieved using large language models (LLMs) and named entity recognition (NER) tools, which identify and extract key entities such as people, places, and events from the text. Additionally, these tools determine the relationships between the extracted entities, establishing meaningful connections that will form the basis of the knowledge graph. The use of state-of-the-art LLMs is critical in this step, as they enhance the accuracy and relevance of the extracted information[1][2].</p> <p>Once entities and their relationships have been identified, the graph construction phase begins. This involves creating a graph object that represents the extracted entities as nodes and their relationships as edges. Each node corresponds to an entity, while edges illustrate the connections between these entities, often enriched with attributes that provide additional context about the relationships. Tools like Neo4j can be utilized to facilitate this graph construction, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of the interconnected data[3].</p> <p>The resulting knowledge graph serves as a structured repository of factual information, enabling GraphRAG to perform complex reasoning tasks. By organizing information in this manner, GraphRAG can effectively navigate through the graph to retrieve relevant knowledge in response to user queries, thereby generating coherent and contextually accurate responses. This structured approach not only enhances the system's ability to handle intricate queries but also improves the overall reliability and accuracy of the information provided[4][5].</p> <p>In summary, the construction of knowledge graphs in GraphRAG is a multi-step process that begins with data collection, followed by entity and relation extraction, and culminates in the creation of a structured graph. This methodology allows GraphRAG to leverage the interconnected nature of knowledge, facilitating improved reasoning and response generation capabilities.</p>"},{"location":"Sample_Output/graphrag/#graph-traversal-and-information-retrieval-in-graphrag","title":"Graph Traversal and Information Retrieval in GraphRAG","text":"<p>GraphRAG employs advanced graph traversal techniques to enhance the retrieval of relevant information and generate contextually aware responses. By integrating knowledge graphs into the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, GraphRAG addresses the limitations of traditional RAG systems, particularly in handling complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning and the synthesis of information from disparate sources.</p> <p>In the indexing phase, GraphRAG begins by segmenting the input corpus into manageable text units, such as paragraphs or sentences. This segmentation allows for a more granular extraction of entities and relationships, which are then organized into a knowledge graph. The knowledge graph serves as a structured representation of the information, capturing the intricate relationships between various entities. This hierarchical organization of data enables GraphRAG to maintain context and preserve the connections that are often lost in traditional vector-based retrieval systems[6].</p> <p>When a user poses a query, GraphRAG utilizes graph traversal techniques to navigate through the knowledge graph. This process involves identifying relevant entities and their relationships based on the user's query. By traversing the graph, GraphRAG can access not only the immediate connections but also the broader context surrounding the entities involved. This capability allows the system to generate responses that are not only accurate but also rich in context, as it can draw upon multiple layers of information that are interconnected within the graph[3].</p> <p>For instance, if a user asks a complex question that requires understanding the relationships between different entities, GraphRAG can traverse the graph to find the necessary connections. It can identify key entities, such as individuals or concepts, and explore their relationships to provide a comprehensive answer. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the answer is not explicitly stated in a single document but requires synthesizing information from various sources[6].</p> <p>Moreover, the use of knowledge graphs in GraphRAG enhances the system's ability to reduce hallucinations\u2014instances where the model generates incorrect or nonsensical information. By grounding responses in a structured knowledge base, GraphRAG ensures that the information retrieved is factual and relevant, thereby improving the overall reliability of the generated responses[3]. </p> <p>In summary, GraphRAG's integration of graph traversal techniques allows it to effectively retrieve and synthesize information from complex datasets, providing users with contextually aware and accurate responses. This innovative approach not only enhances the quality of information retrieval but also aligns closely with human cognitive processes, making it a powerful tool for applications requiring deep understanding and reasoning over interconnected data.</p>"},{"location":"Sample_Output/graphrag/#comparative-analysis-graphrag-vs-traditional-rag","title":"Comparative Analysis: GraphRAG vs. Traditional RAG","text":"<p>GraphRAG represents a significant advancement over traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, particularly in terms of performance, comprehensiveness, and response diversity. Traditional RAG systems typically rely on vector-based retrieval methods, which involve breaking down documents into chunks and converting these into vector embeddings for similarity searches. While this approach can yield relevant information, it often struggles with complex queries that require a nuanced understanding of relationships between disparate pieces of information. For instance, traditional RAG may fail to connect relevant data points spread across multiple documents, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers[2][6].</p> <p>In contrast, GraphRAG enhances the retrieval process by integrating knowledge graphs, which allow for a more structured representation of information. This integration enables GraphRAG to capture intricate relationships between entities, providing a holistic view of the data landscape. As a result, GraphRAG can deliver answers that are not only more accurate but also contextually rich. For example, in a comparative study, GraphRAG achieved a remarkable 90.63% accuracy in answering complex queries, nearly doubling the performance of traditional vector RAG systems, which only managed 46.88% accuracy[9]. This improvement is particularly beneficial in domains that require deep contextual understanding, such as financial analysis or legal document review, where the interconnections between data points are critical for generating informed insights[2][5].</p> <p>Comprehensiveness is another area where GraphRAG excels. Traditional RAG systems often provide answers that are limited in scope, as they primarily focus on retrieving semantically similar text without considering the broader context. GraphRAG, however, leverages its knowledge graph to ensure that responses cover all relevant aspects of a query. This capability is particularly evident in multi-hop reasoning tasks, where GraphRAG can synthesize information from various sources to provide a more complete answer. Research indicates that GraphRAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG in both comprehensiveness and diversity, offering a richer array of perspectives and insights in its responses[3][6].</p> <p>Response diversity is also enhanced in GraphRAG systems. By utilizing a knowledge graph, GraphRAG can generate answers that reflect a variety of viewpoints and interpretations, rather than a single, potentially biased perspective. This is crucial in applications where understanding multiple facets of a topic is essential, such as in news aggregation or sentiment analysis. The ability to pull from a broader range of interconnected data points allows GraphRAG to produce responses that are not only accurate but also varied and nuanced, catering to the complexities of human inquiry[2][5].</p> <p>In summary, GraphRAG's integration of knowledge graphs fundamentally transforms the retrieval-augmented generation landscape. By improving performance, enhancing comprehensiveness, and increasing response diversity, GraphRAG addresses many of the limitations inherent in traditional RAG methods, making it a powerful tool for applications requiring deep understanding and contextual awareness.</p>"},{"location":"Sample_Output/graphrag/#graphrag-sdk-tools-for-developers","title":"GraphRAG-SDK: Tools for Developers","text":"<p>GraphRAG-SDK 0.4.0 is an innovative open-source toolkit designed to streamline the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications utilizing graph databases.
